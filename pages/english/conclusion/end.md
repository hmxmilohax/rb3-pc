You now (hopefully) have set up Rock Band 3 on your PC. While you're here, why not join some communities that are helping with keeping the Rock Band community alive?

## MiloHax

MiloHax is a community centered around modding and preserving the legacy of Harmonix's video games. They've been involved in everything from [[hunting down and preserving prototype copies]](https://hiddenpalace.org/Rock_Band_3_(Jan_19,_2010)){:target="_blank"}, [[decompilation]](https://decomp.dev/DarkRTA/rb3){:target="_blank"}, to being involved in helping emulators such as RPCS3 or shadPS4 improve how they run Harmonix games. 

[You can **\[join the amazing MiloHax Discord here\]**](https://discord.gg/milohax){:target="_blank"}.

## RBEnhanced

Developers of the amazing RBEnhanced mod. The same developers also help run and maintain the GoCentral server that is the online revival server for Rock Band 3. Without this, this game would be a lot lonelier and this guide wouldn't have existed.

## RPCS3

It goes without saying but you wouldn't be playing Rock Band 3 on your PC at the moment without the tremendous work of the talented developers of RPCS3. The amount of work and attention the developers have put into just helping us get this funny plastic instrument game working is tremendous and we're all thankful for it.
