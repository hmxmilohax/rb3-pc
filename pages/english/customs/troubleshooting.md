## Customs not working online / Scores not saving
The PS3 version of Rock Band 3 can only remember scores for numeric song IDs. If a converted song has letters in the song ID, it will create a new one every time the game starts. This means your score is wiped every time.

Online will also have problems, with songs appearing grey even if you and other players have the same song installed. To avoid this, the CON file needs a numeric ID.

You can solve this issue by correcting the IDs with Nautilus.

### Fixing IDs Before Installing

1\. Open Nautilus and select `Batch DTA Processor`.   
![A screenshot of Nautilus. A cursor hovers over "Batch Processor."](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/images/xtra/customs/nautilushomebatchproc.png "Nautilus")

2\. Drag and drop any CON in your folder of customs you want to install then click `Begin` to start processing the entire folder.  
**Make sure that `Automatically change alphanumeric songs IDs to unique numeric IDs` is enabled!**

3\. After it's done, you can close out `Batch DTA Processor` and go back to step 4 of [[the main tutorial]](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/customs_360toPS3#4){:target="_blank"}.

### Fixing IDs of Installed Songs

1\. Open Nautilus and select `PS3 Converter`.  
![A screenshot of Nautilus. A cursor hovers over "PS3 Converter."](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/images/xtra/customs/nautilushomeps3.png "Nautilus")

2\. At the top of the `PS3 Converter` window, go to:  
`Numeric ID Options > Batch replace song IDs`  
![A screenshot of Nautilus's PS3 Converter. A cursor hovers over "Batch replace song IDs" under the "Numeric ID Options" menu.](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/images/xtra/customs/nautilusps3batchid.png "PS3 Converter")

3\. On either PS3 or RPCS3, navigate to song/pack containing the song with the bad ID (normally within `dev_hdd0\game\BLUS30463\USRDIR\[SONGNAME]\songs`).  
After finding it, select the `songs.dta` file within the folder. 
![A screenshot of a file browser window. "dev_hdd0" is selected and the cursor is over "Open".](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/images/xtra/customs/nautilusps3batchselect.png "Select DTA file to edit")

4\. Wait for it to finish correcting every song within that pack. When it finishes, you can share the fixed `songs.dta` file with your friends to play the previously unavailable songs together.

## Songs Stuck Looping at the End
Occasionally certain songs may freeze toward the end of the chart, constantly looping the last bits of the audio endlessly.  
* **You will need need the original CON file to fix this issue!**
* **Do not run every song through this if it does not need fixing, the audio will be re-encoded and will have a slight decrease in audio quality**

1\. Open Nautilus and select `PS3 Converter`.  
![A screenshot of Nautilus. A cursor hovers over "PS3 Converter."](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/images/xtra/customs/nautilushomeps3.png "Nautilus")

2\. At the top of the `PS3 Converter` window, go to:  
`Tools > Batch fix looping songs`

3\. Go to the folder where the problematic CON is at and select the folder.  
Wait for it to finish.

4\. After it's done, you can go back to step 4 of [[the main tutorial]](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/customs_360toPS3#4){:target="_blank"}.

## PS3: Greyed out customs

By default, the PlayStation 3's Parental Controls are set to level 9.  
This doesn't allow customs that are classified as "Unrated", causing them to appear grey. 
![A screenshot of Rock Band 3's song library. It shows as greyed out song.](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/images/xtra/customs/ps3grey.png "Rock Band 3: Grey Songs")

Selecting these songs will cause a crash.
To fix this, set the `Parental Control` to `Off` in:  
XMB: [ **Settings** ] -> [ **Security Settings** ] -> [ **Parental Control** ] -> [ **Off** ]

## Songs still infinite loading

In very rare cases, songs might still have infinite loading, even after the using PS3 fixer.  

You can fix this with Nautilus' Batch Cryptor.  
Do note that you'll need to have "Rock Band 3 Deluxe 1.1 Beta 4" or newer if you're on PS3.  

1\. Open Nautilus and select `Batch Cryptor`.  
![A screenshot of Nautilus. A cursor hovers over "Batch Cryptor."](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/images/xtra/customs/nautilushomecrypt.png "Nautilus")

2\. Swap to `Decrypt` at the bottom of the screen.  
![A screenshot of Batch Cryptor. The mode has been switched to "Decrypt."](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/images/xtra/customs/nautiluscryptdecrypt.png "Batch Cryptor")

3\. For both PS3 and RPCS3 users, navigate to the folder containing the song you wish to fix.  
It will usually be in `dev_hdd0\game\BLUS30463\USRDIR\[PACKNAME]\songs\[PROBLEMATICSONG]`).  
There will be a `.mogg` file in the song's folder.  
![A screenshot of a file browser window. A mogg file is selected.](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/images/xtra/customs/findmogg.png "MOGG File")

4\. Drag and drop the song's `.mogg` file onto `Batch Cryptor` and click `Begin`.  
![A GIF of a .mogg file being dropped into "Batch Cryptor" the being decrypted.](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/images/xtra/customs/nautiluscryptdecryptmogg.gif "Quick Convert")

5\. A new folder called `decrypted` will appear when it finishes.  
Go into the new `decrypted` folder and cut the `.mogg` file inside of it.  
Go back to the song's main folder and replace the old `.mogg` file.
