Over time, you might amass a large amount of customs folders. This is a problem since, the more folders you have, the longer Rock Band 3 takes to count your songs.

Ideally, you should put as many songs as possible into a pack to load things efficiently.

Thanks to Onyx, you can do this easily! It is basically the same as the earlier as [[the Xbox 360 CON to PS3/RPCS3 format tutorial]](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/customs_360toPS3).  
Before starting, keep in mind that you will temporarily need to have the original separated packs and the merged pack installed.  
Make sure you have enough space!

#### 1.
Open a file browser and navigate to where your customs are installed.  
This is normally within `dev_hdd0\game\BLUS30463\USRDIR\`.  
For PS3, you will have to transfer the folder you want to combine to your computer for processing, which may take a while.  
If you're on RPCS3, you can get there quickly by right clicking Rock Band 3 within RPCS3 then `Open Folder > Open Game Data Folder`.

#### 2.
Now, open Onyx Music Game Toolkit and click `Quick convert/pack`.

#### 3.
Stay on the `RB quick convert + pack creator` tab.  
Drag and drop the folders you want to merge or click on `Add Rock Band Song` to select them.

It is also recommended to enable `Author to DTA tag` at the bottom right.

#### 4.
Below the first row of gray buttons, click the first menu and select `Make Packs`.  
`Make Songs` is useless in this context since it will create loose folders.  
![A screenshot of Onyx's Quick Convert screen. "Make songs: produced a single file for each song" has been clicked and the cursor is over "Make packs: combine songs up to a maximum file size."](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/images/xtra/customs/onyxmakepacksmerge.png "Quick Convert")

#### 5.
At the bottom left, make sure `Encrypt .mid.edat` is enabled, then select between either `PKG (PS3)` or `Folders (PS3)`.  
* `Folders (PS3)` is recommended for RPCS3 users and PS3 users who know how to use FTP. It is **much** faster than PKG creation. You can also bypass the 4GB folder limit.
* `PKG (PS3)` is only recommended for PS3 users who can only use USB flash drives to add more songs.

<h4>6.</h4>
<p><em>(Optional but highly recommended)</em><br>
By default, Onyx will generate a folder with a name based on the first (or only) song in the pack, like <code>OxxxxxSongName</code>.<br>
It's suggested to enter a custom name. Simply change <code>Combine into one new USRDIR subfolder per pack</code> to <code>Custom USRDIR subfolder</code>.<br>

<h4>7.</h4>
<p><em>(Optional but highly recommended)</em><br>
Since you'll be installing things as loose folders and files, you can easily bypass the 4000 MiB (or 4GB) folder limit. You can use this to pack extra dense folders!<br>
Simply change the number at the bottom left to something absurdly high like <code>99999</code><br>
<img src="https://rb3pc.milohax.org/images/xtra/customs/onyxmakepackfilesize.png" alt="A screenshot of Onyx's Quick Convert screen. &quot;Max Pack Size (MiB)&quot; has been set to &quot;99999&quot;." title="Quick Convert"></p>
<h4>8.</h4>
<p>At the bottom, select the big button labeled <code>Make pack</code> (or <code>Start</code> if you used the <code>Make Songs</code> option.)<br>

<p>Navigate to your RPCS3 folder and select the <code>dev_hdd0</code> folder.<br>
If you're going to be installing to a PS3 via FTP, select the most convenient folder.<br>

<p>It should successfully convert and auto-install into your RPCS3 directory, ready to play.<br>
If using RB3DX, you can even do this while the game is running. Within RB3, select:<br>
<code>Options &gt; Extras &gt; Refresh Library</code> to reload your song list.<br>
