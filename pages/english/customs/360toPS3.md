#### 8.
Below the first row of gray buttons, click the first menu and select `Make Packs` or `Make Songs` depending on how you want to combine your songs (packs are recommended).  
![A screenshot of Onyx's Quick Convert screen. "Make songs: produced a single file for each song" has been clicked and the cursor is over "Make packs: combine songs up to a maximum file size."](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/images/xtra/customs/onyxmakepacks.png "Quick Convert")

#### 9.
At the bottom left, make sure `Encrypt .mid.edat` is enabled, then select between either `PKG (PS3)` or `Folders (PS3)`.  
* `Folders (PS3)` is recommended for RPCS3 users and PS3 users who know how to use FTP. It is **much** faster than PKG creation.
* `PKG (PS3)` is only recommended for PS3 users who can only use USB flash drives to add more songs.

<p><em>(Optional but highly recommended)</em><br>
By default, Onyx will generate a folder with a name based on the first (or only) song in the pack, like <code>OxxxxxSongName</code>.<br>
It's suggested to enter a custom name. Simply change <code>Combine into one new USRDIR subfolder per pack</code> to <code>Custom USRDIR subfolder</code>.<br>
