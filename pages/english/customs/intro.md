Custom songs for Rock Band 3 are generally made with only the Xbox 360 in mind. Likewise, various files of official content (made by Harmonix) are like this. They exist as CON files that can be converted to work with the PS3 version of the game. This guide will show you how to convert these files to formats that can be used on PS3 and emulator!


Following the guide will help prevent common issues before they happen. There is also a troubleshooting page to fix customs with problems such as:
* Infinite loading from improper encryption
* Crashes from audio quality

### Requirements:
* A modded PS3 console (with a method of transferring files to it) or the [[RPCS3 emulator]](https://carlmylo.github.io/rb3-pc/gs_disc){:target="_blank"}
* [[An installation of Rock Band 3 Deluxe]](https://rb3dx.milohax.org/){:target="_blank"} (Optional but highly recommended)
* [[Nautilus version 4.8.4 or later]](https://nemosnautilus.com/nautilus/){:target="_blank"} (Previously known as C3 CON Tools/C3Tools)
	* [[Mirror Link]](https://github.com/trojannemo/Nautilus/releases/){:target="_blank"}
* [[Onyx Music Game Toolkit]](https://github.com/mtolly/onyxite-customs){:target="_blank"}
