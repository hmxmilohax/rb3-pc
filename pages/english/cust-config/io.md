![A screenshot of Rock Band 3's I/O custom settings, showing "Keyboard Handler", Emulated MIDI Devices", "device type", and "device selection" highlighted in tan with a solid outline, and "Pad Handler Mode" and "Keep Pads Connected" highlighted in blue with a dotted outline.](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/images/cust/io.png "I/O")

* ![A blue square with a dotted outline.](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/images/cust/smallblue.png "Tan Square") **Performance Tweaks**: 
	* **Change "`Pad Handler Mode`" to "`Multi-threaded`"** - May help with thread distribution, which improves performance.
	* **Enable "`Keep Pads Connected`"** - This can help fix a problem with certain instrument controllers softlocking the game when RPCS3 interfaces, such as the RPCN invites, come up.

* ![A tan square with a solid outline.](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/images/cust/smalltan.png "Tan Square") **Recommended**: 
	* **Change "`Keyboard Handler`" to "`Basic`"** to use features such as searching in the song library on Rock Band 3 Deluxe.
	* üéπ **[[MIDI Keyboard Players]](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/ctrls_keys_midi){:target="_blank"}: Leave your "`Emulated MIDI type`" on "`Keyboard`" and select your keyboard or MIDI interface in the drop-down menu next to it**.
	* üé∏ **[[MIDI Pro Guitar Players]](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/ctrls_protar_midi){:target="_blank"}: Change your "`Emulated MIDI type`" from "`Keyboard`" to "`Guitar (17 Frets)`" if you have a Mustang Pro Guitar, or "`Guitar (22 Frets)`" if you have a Squier Pro Guitar, then select your MIDI to USB interface in the drop-down menu next to it**.
	* ü•Å **[[MIDI Pro Drums Players]](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/ctrls_drums_midi){:target="_blank"}: Change your "`Emulated MIDI type`" from "`Keyboard`" to "`Drums`", then select your MIDI Drum Kit or MIDI to USB interface in the drop-down menu next to it**.
