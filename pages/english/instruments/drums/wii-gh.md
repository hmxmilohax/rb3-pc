## NOTES:

* Velocity sensitivity doesn't seem to work.
* Can be used to play on Pro Drums to an extent but it's not suggested.
* Gem colors do not match the pads.
* This was tested with a Raphnet "Classic controller to USB adapter".
	* If the controller doesn't work at all, try installing [[Raphnet's management tool]](https://www.raphnet-tech.com/products/adapter_manager/index.php).
* RPCN Menus (for sending or accepting online invites) may cause a softlock. You may need an alternative input method to navigate these menus, such as [[a typing keyboard or a gamepad]](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/ctrls_pads){:target="_blank"}.

## Mapping

* Guitar Hero controllers tend to misbehave and **refuse to map sometimes. If you try mapping a button and always get "U+" or something similar, click "Filter Noise"** at the bottom left of the controller configuration window **then try mapping**.
