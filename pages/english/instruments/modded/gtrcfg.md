## NOTES:

* This information is outdated, just like your software. **UPDATE TO SANTROLLER, OR CONTACT YOUR GUITAR MANUFACTURER!**
* This requires advanced setup.
* Tilt does not work. Various things have been attempted to get it to work, but the weird gyroscope configuration does not work well with RPCS3 and constantly inputs garbage.

* Change the controller output type to XInput and Guitar Hero Guitar.
