Now, **go to the folder where you extracted RPCS3.** Keep this folder open in the background. **Open up RPCS3**. **Tick "I have read the Quickstart guide" and "Do not show again", then click "Continue."**

## Firmware

**Drag** the **PS3UPDAT.PUP** file you just downloaded from Sony's website **into RPCS3**. 

![A GIF of PS3UPDAT.PUP being dragged into RPCS3.](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/images/install/rpcs3fwdnd.gif "PST3UPDAT.PUP")

**Click "Yes"** when the firmware installer prompts you.

**Let it install.**  
![A screenshot of RPCS3's Firmware Installer in the middle of installing firmware version 4.90.](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/images/install/rpcs3fw.png "RPCS3 Firmware Installer progress")

**When it finishes, click "OK."**

It will start compiling modules to load the PS3 XMB into the emulator, which may take a few minutes. **You can either let it do its thing or close it.**

## Rock Band 3

Next, **open a new file browser window. Now go to the folder where you have your copy of Rock Band 3 stored and drag the folder into RPCS3's "games" folder**. Again, you're on your own when it comes to finding a copy. [[I used "PS3 Disc Dumper" for this because it's the easiest way]](https://youtu.be/mRxSKxoYt_g){:target="_blank"}.

After dragging it in, click "Refresh" in RPCS3.

## Rock Band 3 Deluxe

After Rock Band 3 appears in your library, go get [**[*Rock Band 3 Deluxe*]**](https://rb3dx.milohax.org/){:target="_blank"}.

This is a must-have mod, which also fixes some critical bugs RPCS3 has with Rock Band 3. On top of that, it adds [**[many great features]**](https://rb3dx.milohax.org/features){:target="_blank"}.

[**[Click here to download Rock Band 3 Deluxe]**](https://rb3dx.milohax.org/downloads){:target="_blank"}.
