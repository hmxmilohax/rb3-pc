## Guitar Patch

You can eliminate 99% of guitar teleportation bugs by installing a work-in-progress patch. First, download the [[`rb3_ps3_guitar_glitch_fix.7z` archive]](https://github.com/hmxmilohax/rock-band-3-deluxe/raw/main/dependencies/ps3_patcher/rb3_ps3_guitar_glitch_fix.7z).

Extract the `rb3_ps3_guitar_glitch_fix.7z` archive. Move this window to the right and leave it open.

Next, go to where your game's disc folder is located.  
The quickest way to get there is to right click Rock Band 3 in RPCS3 and go to `Open Folder > Open Disc Game Folder`. Move this window to the left.

After that:
1. Go into `PS3_GAME > USRDIR` on the left window.  
2. On the right window, go into the `rb3_ps3_guitar_glitch_fix` folder you extracted. 
3. You should see `gen` in both file browser windows.
4. Drag the `gen` folder from the right `rb3_ps3_guitar_glitch_fix` folder to the left `USRDIR` folder.  
5. Click `Replace the file in the destination` when prompted.

That's it!

# Problematic Items

Below are equipable items which are documented to have issues with visual glitches. Avoid these items if you don't want to have visual teleporting glitches.

## Microphones

Just about every single microphone has issues, **except the Clear Microphone**. This is the **only** microphone you want to use if you want to avoid teleporting.
