### AshCentral: RPCN

AshCentral works with RPCN's friend system, so you can send and receive invites to play with friends easily. 

**PLEASE NOTE THAT YOU CAN ONLY ADD AND INVITE FRIENDS ON RPCS3, NOT FRIENDS ON PLAYSTATION 3 HARDWARE!** You can still play with PS3 players by searching for them.

Let's go over how to manage friends in RPCN.

Go to **Configuration > RPCN**

Click on **Friends**.

This will open the Friends window.

Once here, you can add friends in different ways including:

#### AshCentral: RPCN: Adding by Search

**To add a friend** by their username, **click on "Add Friend"**, at the bottom side of the RPCN: Friends window.

A popup will appear. **Type in your friend's username then click "OK".**

If you typed in their name correctly, you should see a "Friend added!" popup. The icon next to their name will be orange until they add you. **Once they accept your request, that's it!**

#### AshCentral: RPCN: Accepting Friend Requests

Any friend requests will be below "Friend Requests" in the RPCN:Friends window, with a yellow icon next to their name. **To accept any requests,** simply **right click the request and click "Accept Request."**
