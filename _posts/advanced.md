* ![A green square with a dashed outline.](images/cust/smallgreen.png "Green Square") **REQUIRED**: 
	* **Change "Driver Wake-up Delay" to "20µ"** to avoid crashing after a few songs. Increase it to "40µ" if the issue persists.
* ![A blue square with a dotted outline.](images/cust/smallblue.png "Tan Square") **Depending on your computer**: 
	* **Adjust VBlank Frequency** if you want a higher internal framerate. This can make it easier to hit notes but may cause graphical instability and connection issues while online. **It's best left alone** and not recommended to go above 75 Hz if adjusting it for online play. Increasing it exponentially uses more CPU and GPU.
		* Once again, having a higher VBlank can cause issues with vocal detection.
	* **Change "Maximum Number of SPURS Threads"** - May improve performance on systems with less cores and threads [[like 4th gen Intel i5 CPUs with 4 cores and 4 threads]](https://github.com/carlmylo/rb3-pc/issues/12#issue-1955946005).
* ![A tan square with a solid outline.](images/cust/smalltan.png "Tan Square") **Strongly Suggested**: 
	* **Enable "Debug Console Mode"** - With Rock Band 3 Deluxe installed, and "Large Heap" enabled in its settings, along with this option enabled, you can take advantage of higher memory access, leading to longer sessions with longer songs and increased stability. If your computer is within the minimum (or higher) requirements, there's no reason you shouldn't enable this.
	* **Change "Exclusive Fullscreen Mode" to "Prefer borderless fullscreen"** to prevent potential crashes and audio desync when changing from Rock Band 3 to another program while in fullscreen.
