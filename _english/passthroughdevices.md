**If you're not playing with a PS3 Mustang Pro Guitar or a PS3 Keyboard with their respective dongles**, [[**skip over this section**]](https://hmxmilohax.github.io/rb3-pc/english/troubleshooting/).

To start with, **close out RPCS3** **and plug in the instrument's dongle** to your computer.

Now, [**\[go to Zadig's website\]**](https://zadig.akeo.ie/) and **download the latest version, then open it** up.

Click on **Options** then **List All Devices**.

You should now see devices listed. **Switch it to your Rock Band 3 Pro Instrument**. In this example, we're using the Mustang Pro Guitar, which shows up as “Harmonix RB3 Mustang Guitar for PlayStation® 3”.

**After selecting the right device, you should see the option to replace the driver. _MAKE SURE YOU ARE REPLACING THE DRIVER ONLY FOR THE PRO GUITAR/KEYBOARD!!_** Click Replace Driver.

A warning will appear. **Again, make sure you have selected your RB3 Pro Guitar or keyboard instrument.** After you have made sure, **click** “**Yes**.”

It will then install the driver. As the program says, it may take a few minutes.

If everything goes well, you will get this message:  
![A screenshot of Zadig telling the user that the driver was installed successfully with "Close" highlighted.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hmxmilohax/rb3-pc/main/assets/images/pass/zadigdone.png "Zadig: Success")

**Close Zadig** and, **with the dongle** still **connected**, **open up RPCS3** and **open Rock Band 3**.

Turn your controller on and you should see it automatically assign a player number.

Likewise, in Rock Band 3, you will see the instrument ready to join.
