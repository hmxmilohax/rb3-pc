## NOTES

* Requires installing and running [[**RB4InstrummentMapper**]](https://github.com/TheNathannator/RB4InstrumentMapper/)
* Works with or without the Pro Cymbal expansions.
	* Make sure to tell the game which cymbals are connected in the Drum Options menu.
* Velocity sensitivity doesn't seem to work.
* RPCN Menus (for sending or accepting online invites) may cause a softlock. You may need an alternative input method to navigate these menus, such as a typing keyboard or a gamepad.

## Mapping

### Controller Emulation Mode: ViGEmBus (RPCS3 compatibility)

This is the recommended mode and should not require any mapping. You simply need to assign the Handler, Device, and Device Class/Type.

### Controller Emulation Mode: ViGEmBus

[[Download Profile]](https://github.com/hmxmilohax/rb3-pc/raw/main/instrument-repo/Xbox%20360%20Rock%20Band%20Drums.7z)

This is not suggested as it requires lots of manual mapping. You should instead use **ViGEmBus (RPCS3 compatibility)**.

* Rock Band Drums send multiple button presses out at once. For example, a Red pad will send "`B`" and "`Right Stick Click`" (which translates to "`Circle`" and "`L3`".) Keep in mind these are needed to the emulator to tell your cymbals apart.
	* It's strongly suggested to bind an Xbox controller like the Mapping screenshot below then swapping the Device to your Xbox 360 Rock Band Drums.
* To bind multiple buttons to one RPCS3 button, hold Shift then click on the RPCS3 button you want to assign multiple buttons to.
