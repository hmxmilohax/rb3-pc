## NOTES:

* It's strongly suggested you connect your Pro Guitar with the dongle, if you have it. [[Click here for instructions on how to set that up.]](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/english/passthroughdevices/)
* **Requires a MIDI to USB Interface that has SYSEX support!** Consult your MIDI to USB interface's manual or manufacturer for more details.
	* The M-Audio Midisport Uno is recommended as it has been verified to work.
* This is meant for players that have their PRO Guitars connected via a MIDI to USB interface.

## Instructions:
**Right click on Rock Band 3** in RPCS3, then click on “**Change Custom Configuration**”.
