## NOTES:

* **NOT A RECOMMENDED CONTROLLER** but kept in this list since it's unlikely many people will have this and since not much documentation exists on this controller.
* Whammy doesn't work, which means a crucial gameplay element doesn't work.
* Tilt does not work. Various things have been attempted to get it to work, but the weird gyroscope configuration does not work well with RPCS3 and constantly inputs garbage.
